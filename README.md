## 1. Program Purpose
- What will a user use your program to do?
- What problem does your program solve for users?
- What does your program do? Again, use your creativity here.
## 2. Input, Output, and Memory Management
- What input will a user need to provide?
- What output is the program expected to generate?
- What variables will your program need to define?
- How much memory will your program require to operate?
## 3. Functions Needed
- List 3–6 functions your program will require.
 Example: int addNumbers(int a, int b);
## 4. Data Structures
- Define a simple struct to use in your program.
- This struct should represent the “object” of your program
 Example: a Student struct might have members such as name, age, grade.
 ```c
 typedef struct {

 };
 ```
## 5. File Responsibilities - The following files are required in your project submission. Describe the purpose and contents of each file.
